# Image_Classification_Using_CNN_with_Keras

This a Simple tutorial on CNN( Convolutional Neural Network) also known as ConvNet with Keras, In this tutorial we have a collection of Butterfly Images that are based upon 10 different species of butterfly, Given an Image we have to classify the specie of the Butterfly, So the 10 species are :

'001': 'Danaus_plexippus'
'002': 'Heliconius_charitonius'
'003': 'Heliconius_erato'
'004': 'Junonia_coenia'
'005': 'Lycaena_phlaeas'
'006': 'Nymphalis_antiopa'
'007': 'Papilio_cresphontes'
'008': 'Pieris_rapae'
'009': 'Vanessa_atalanta'
'010': 'Vanessa_cardui' In this dataset we have a collection of 832 Images, that are labeled as per their specie code (i.e '001': 'Danaus_plexippus' , '002': 'Heliconius_charitonius' ... and so on)
